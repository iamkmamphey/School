      <h2>Introduction: When God Speaks, But Life Looks Different</h2>
<p><strong>Genesis 12:4-5</strong>  So Abram went, as the Lord had told him; and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he set out from Harran. 5 He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in Harran, and they set out for the land of Canaan, and they arrived there.
<p><strong>Genesis 15:4-6 </strong> Then the word of the Lord came to him: “This man will not be your heir, but a son who is your own flesh and blood will be your heir.” 5 He took him outside and said, “Look up at the sky and count the stars—if indeed you can count them.” Then he said to him, “So shall your offspring be.” 6 Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness
Looking at Abraham’s situation, having Ismael was a fulfilment of that promise but God said no, in the process, God expect us to follow, not to go our own way. 
<p><strong>Proverbs 14:12</strong> There is a way that appears to be right, but in the end, it leads to death.</p>
Our ways may momentarily looks the perfect solution, but we may regret ever settling on such as an answer.</p>
Birth of Isaac: Isaac was born when Abraham was 100 years old and Sarah was 90
 <p><strong>Genesis 21:5</strong> Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</p>
So, if we were to do a little Calculation, 100 − 75 = <strong>25</strong> years of waiting between the promise and its fulfillment.</p>
This long waiting period highlights God’s perfect timing and the importance of faith and patience during the Process.
<p> "Many believers struggle not with hearing God's promises, but with enduring the Process that brings them to pass."</p>
<p>Welcome to the prophecy and the Process</p>
